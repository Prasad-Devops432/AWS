Public IP:
What: Internet-routable IP (e.g., 54.123.45.67).
Example: A web server’s public IP lets users access a website (e.g., www.example.com).
Behavior: Dynamic unless using an Elastic IP.


Private IP:
What: Non-internet-routable IP (e.g., 10.0.1.10).
Example: A database server in a private subnet communicates with a web server using its private IP.
Behavior: Fixed within the VPC.
Difference: Public IPs allow internet access; private IPs are for internal VPC communication.
Real-World Example: A company’s public-facing website uses a public IP, while its internal payroll system uses a private IP.
