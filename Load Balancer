What: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances for availability and performance.

Real-World Example: A busy restaurant (your app) has multiple waiters (EC2 instances). A host (Load Balancer) assigns customers (traffic) to available waiters to prevent overload and ensure quick service.

Types:
ALB (Application Load Balancer): For HTTP/HTTPS (e.g., routes traffic to a web appâ€™s login page).
NLB (Network Load Balancer): For TCP/UDP (e.g., gaming servers with low-latency needs).
GLB (Gateway Load Balancer): For third-party firewalls (e.g., security appliances).

Example: Netflix uses ALBs to distribute streaming requests across servers globally, ensuring smooth playback.
