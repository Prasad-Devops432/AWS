What is Auto Scaling?
Automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances based on demand or conditions.
Example: A pizza shop (your app) gets busy during lunch hours. Auto Scaling is like hiring extra delivery drivers (EC2 instances) when orders spike (high CPU usage) and sending them home when itâ€™s quiet (low demand).


How it Works:
Auto Scaling Group: Defines min/max instances (e.g., 2-10 servers).
Scaling Policy: Triggers based on metrics (e.g., scale out if CPU > 70%).
Example: An e-commerce site scales up during Black Friday sales to handle traffic, then scales down afterward to save costs.
Components: Launch Template (instance specs), CloudWatch (monitors metrics).
