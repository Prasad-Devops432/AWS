NAT Gateway
What: Allows private subnet instances to access the internet (outbound) while blocking inbound connections.

Real-World Example: A private office (private subnet) uses a secure internet gateway (NAT Gateway) to let employees download software updates without exposing the office to external hackers.

How it Works:
Deployed in a public subnet with an Elastic IP.
Routes outbound traffic from private instances.
Example: A database server in a private subnet uses a NAT Gateway to fetch security patches without being publicly accessible
